# AtliQ-Grands-Hospitality-analysis


# Introduction
AtliQ Grands, a well-established chain of five-star hotels in India, has been a leading name in the hospitality industry for over two decades. With a strong presence in major cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad, AtliQ Grands is known for providing luxury accommodations and exceptional service.

# Problem Statement
Despite its strong reputation, AtliQ Grands has been losing market share and revenue in the competitive luxury and business hotel segments due to competitor strategies and poor management decisions. To address this, the managing director has opted to integrate 'Business and Data Intelligence' into their operations. As they lack an internal data analytics team, AtliQ Grands has hired a third-party data analytics team to analyze their historical data and provide actionable insights to help the company regain its market position.

                      For underperforming cities like Hyderabad, targeted marketing campaigns and service improvements can help boost revenue.

- City-Specific Strategies: Bangalore, with the lowest occupancy and ratings, could benefit from customer feedback analysis to address service gaps and improve overall experience.
                            For high-performing cities like Delhi, maintaining quality while offering new services can further enhance customer satisfaction.

- Peak Season Promotion: With May experiencing the highest number of bookings, consider offering special packages, incentives, and promotions during this time to further boost demand.

- Room Class Optimization: Given the popularity of Elite rooms, consider increasing availability or offering bundled packages. 
                           To reduce cancellations, implement more flexible booking policies or offer incentives to commit to reservations.

- Platform Expansion: While Make Your Trip is the leading platform in hotel booking, diversifying partnerships with other booking platforms can help attract more customers and reduce 
                      dependency on a single platform.
