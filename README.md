# Introduction
AtliQ Grands, a well-established chain of five-star hotels in India, has been a leading name in the hospitality industry for over two decades. With a strong presence in major cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad, AtliQ Grands is known for providing luxury accommodations and exceptional service.

# Problem Statement
Despite its strong reputation, AtliQ Grands has been losing market share and revenue in the competitive luxury and business hotel segments due to competitor strategies and poor management decisions. To address this, the managing director has opted to integrate 'Business and Data Intelligence' into their operations. As they lack an internal data analytics team, AtliQ Grands has hired a third-party data analytics team to analyze their historical data and provide actionable insights to help the company regain its market position.
